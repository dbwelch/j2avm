UPDATE - June 16, 2011 - I could not escape Flash. I'm finding that I actually need to resurrect and use the j2swf and (maybe j2avm) tools for a commercial project. I don't want to continue writing Java, so I might start adding new code in Clojure, or lift the whole thing up into a model and use code-generation. I'll write a new post when things are figured out.

See http://epistemologicalengineering.blogspot.com/2011/06/update-to-status-of-flash-projects.html

J2AVM translates JVM bytecode to AVM2 bytecode, with the intention of making Java (and maybe other JVM languages) a first class development language for Flash and AIR.

The initial goal is to allow Java code to be written against a Java representation of the built-in Flash player classes.
Longer term goals may include support for a number of Java libraries, to enable arbitrary code to be translated.

Progress updates are informally posted on this blog: [http://epistemologicalengineering.blogspot.com/](http://epistemologicalengineering.blogspot.com/)
